# workflow-software-templates

This repository is a collection of software and documentation templates for the Backstage Orchestrator plugin. The templates are organized into two folders: `scaffolder-templates` for Software Templates and `documentation-templates` for general documentation templates. Contributions are welcome for new and existing templates!

## scaffolder-templates

[Backstage Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) are used to create new software components through Backstage. This concept is leveraged in the Orchestrator plugin to create templates that are intended as a starting point to build on for different use cases such as basic assessment or infrastructure workflows or assessment workflows using custom java code.

## documentation-templates

The documentation templates provide recommended structure and integration documentation with the Orchestrator deployment.
